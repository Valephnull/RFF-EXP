# RFF-EXP

## What is this fork?

This fork (RFF Exploration Edition) adds a whole bunch of new exploration features, mostly from other fractal explorers, to RFF, with the goal of making a better experience deep zooming

## New Features

Currently, I have added:

* Newton-Raphson Zooming menu - basically Kalles Fraktaler's Newton-Raphson menu
* Auto Exploration menu - basically Fractal eXtreme's menu but better, and with more features
* Autosave - If a crash happens, you can get back to that location next time you launch RFF-EXP
* Render Pool - Render RFF keyframe sequences on multiple computers

## Installation

Run `installer_windows.bat` as Administrator on Windows, or run `./installer_linux_ubuntu.sh` on Ubuntu 24.04 or newer

## About upstream RFF

- This program uses `Fast-period-guessing`*(a.k.a. FPG)* which I developed. It automatically generates the `longest period` of the selected location.
This value is unmodifiable.

- This program uses an `Multi-level Periodic Approximation` algorithm which I developed.
It is derived from `BLA` but completely replaces traditional `BLA`, achieving speedups of more than 2 times. \
To put it simply, it skips to the `Periodic point` directly.


- You can specify a compressor to render even extremely long period using less memory. \
Of course, the approximation table can also be compressed using this algorithm, and jumps a <u>**HUGE**</u> process! \
Therefore, If you are trying to render long periods (over `10,000,000` or so), You should compress the references. \
This will be <u>**SIGNIFICANTLY**</u> faster because it <u>**SUPERJUMPS**</u> process of table creation.


- If it is still slow, Try using a Compute Shader! it is extremely powerful for Spiral patterns like `Seahorse Valley`, `Elephant Valley`.


- Save amazing images using shaders!

## Get Started

- It's very simple. Just go into the `releases`,
download the zip,
unzip it and run installer.

- Or you can build manually.

### Requirements
*IMPORTANT : To use this application, the GPU must support `Vulkan`.*

If the following error occurs even though `Vulkan` is installed correctly, it is caused by the GPU not supporting `Vulkan`.
In this case, use version `2.0.12.1`. Supported OS of this version is only Windows.
```terminaloutput
- [INITIALIZE] No suitable physical device found

- registry lookup failed to get layer manifest file
```

### Launch Application
#### installation
Run the installer in the extracted `RFF.zip`.

The installer script handles the entire process:
- installing build tools
- build
- creating the executable

Therefore, you should run the installer as Administrator.
If you are unsure exactly what is being executed, the following tasks run automatically.

#### for Windows
If it does not run immediately after zip extraction, try the following steps.

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
2. Launch `clang64.exe`
3. Update MSYS2 packages:
```bash
pacman -Syu
```

4. Restart `clang64.exe`

5. Install required packages:
```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-gmp  # If you want to build gmp manually, do not run that command.
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-make
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-cmake
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-ninja
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-clang
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-opencv
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-vulkan
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-glm
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-glfw
```

6. Add the following directory to your Windows environment variable:
```text
MSYS2_ROOT : your-installed-msys2-path
Path : %MSYS2_ROOT%\clang64\bin
```

7. Restart the terminal or your PC after updating the environment variables.


#### for Linux (Ubuntu 24.04)


```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y clang clang-tools build-essential make cmake libopencv-dev libvulkan-dev libglm-dev ninja-build libgtk-3-dev git wget xz-utils libglfw3-dev

wget https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.3.0.tar.xz
# You can get any version from https://gmplib.org/download/snapshot/gmp-next/
tar -xf gmp-6.3.0.tar.xz
cd gmp-6.3.0
mkdir build
cd build


../configure CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native"
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
cd ~

sudo ldconfig

```


### Build
The dependency [libgmp](https://gmplib.org/download/snapshot) must be built separately.

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Merutilm/RFF-2.0
cd RFF-2.0
mkdir extern
cd extern
git clone https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
cd ..
mkdir build

cmake -B build -G "Ninja" -S . \
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

./build/bin/RFF
```



### Troubleshooting
#### for Windows
If the built application does not launch:

- Make sure `clang64\bin` is added to your `Path`
- Restart the terminal or your PC
- Launch the application from `clang64.exe`
- Verify required DLLs exist in `clang64\bin`

```bash
mkdir build

cmake -B build -G "Ninja" -S . \
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
-DSAFE_EXP_OPERATOR=ON

cmake --build build
```


## Features
- The status bar on the window means the following (from left to right):

1. The iterations of the pixel pointed to by the mouse cursor
2. The zoom of current location.
3. The estimated period of this location. (The number in parentheses is the length of the Reference and `MPA` array.)
4. The elapsed time since the calculation started
5. The Process

- Video renderer is built-in!
1. Use `Dynamic Map` or `Static Map` to generate video `keyframes`. \
This option is in `Data Settings` in `Video` menu.
2. `Dynamic Map` stores whole iteration data each pixel. It requires large capacity. \
the extension is `.rfm`.
3. `Static Map` stores as `image` and `info` files. It requires less capacity but also the most `shaders` are disabled. \
the extension of `info` file is `.rfsm`.
4. Export your own Video using existing `keyframes`.


- Find the nearest Minibrot with `Locate Minibrot` in `Explore` menu.
- More features will be added soon.

## Known Issues & Problems
- The program was compiled with -ffast-math, so sometimes results incorrect image at some location.

- This is weak for complex spiral patterns and mandelbrot plane, because there are only formulas for the recursive julia sets.
  I will add that formulas in the future.

- Compute shader renders using single precision; it is fast but inaccurate.
This can lead to trouble in specific high-rotation count locations,
the trouble was found at the following location: `1E20 main-bulb Elephant Valley` and `Elephant² Valley`.

- An issue occurs where the reference calculation slows down unusually at the certain very deep locations.
